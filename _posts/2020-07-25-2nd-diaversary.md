The end of July marks the end of my second year with type 1 diabetes. If I found a way to rewind time to two years ago - to the evening of my diagnosis - and to tell myself that everything would be ok two years on, I would have bitterly laughed in my own face (or screamed in fear at the fact a copy of myself from the future was sat talking to me), and repeated the thoughts in my head that evening: "I can't live with this". Of course now this sounds like a ridiculous thing to think (I was never a great stoic, I'm far too meladramatic for that) but at the time it was all I could think. I had watched my brother grow up with this condition for the best part of a decade previous, and I always remember thinking I'd rather be dead than ever have to deal with what I saw him fighting with.
