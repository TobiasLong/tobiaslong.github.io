Hi there, my name is Tobias!

I'm currently a PhD student working in *Quantitative and Biophysical Biology* at *The University of Manchester*. I studied for a BSc in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* before completing my MSc in *Mathematical Medicine and Biology*, both at *The University of Nottingham*. I also have Type 1 diabetes, with which I was diagnosed in the summer following the third year of my *BSc*. This was one of the reasons I moved over to study a more biology-focused MSc!
