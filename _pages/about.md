Hi, my name is Tobias!

I'm currently a PhD student working on the next generation of silent aerospace propulsion configurations, based in the Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering at the *University of Nottingham*. I graduated with a first-class BSc (Hons) degree in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* before completing my MSc in *Mathematical Medicine and Biology*, both at the *University of Nottingham* from 2015 to 2019. I also have Type 1 diabetes, with which I was diagnosed in the summer following the third year of my *BSc*. This was one of the reasons I moved over to study a more biology-focused MSc, before returning to a more physics-based discipline for my current PhD research.

I am part of the group of Xuerui Mao ([Mao Lab Website](https://mao-lab.com/)), working on reduced order modelling of distributed propulsion propeller layouts.

In my non-academic time I mainly enjoy cycling, reading and gaming.
