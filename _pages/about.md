Hi there, my name is Tobias!

I'm currently a PhD student completing rotation projects in my first year on the *Quantitative and Biophysical Biology* programme at  the *University of Manchester*. I studied for a BSc in *Physics with Theoretical Physics* before completing my MSc in *Mathematical Medicine and Biology*, both at the *University of Nottingham*. I also have Type 1 diabetes, with which I was diagnosed in the summer following the third year of my *BSc*. This was one of the reasons I moved over to study a more biology-focused MSc!

In my non-academic time I mainly enjoy reading, teaching myself the drums or taking the time to cook a decent meal. I have also recently taken up pole fitness (no, I'm not any good) and I spend a *lot* of time trying to figure out how to think and act like a human pancreas (and no, I'm also not any good at this).
